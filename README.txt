How to start demo?

- Start the 4d_web_app_demo_v15.4dbase file with 4Dv15.2 or upwards
- On Startup 4D method should automatically open url in default browser: http://localhost:8080/book-shelf-app/index.shtml
- On Startup 4D method should automatically also open url in 4D Web Area too for demonstration of Book Shelf App in Web Area. In Web Area slightly different version is opened : index-webarea.shtml
- If no web browser is opened on startup open a web browser and then type http://localhost:8080/book-shelf-app/index.shtml in url field

Notes

- 4d_web_app_demo_v15.4dbase is a simple books DB which demonstrates how to show 4D Database of books in HTML book shelf format
- There are a few sample book records to show how it works
- Inside 4d_web_app_demo_v15.4dbase package there is Webfolder directory which you should have index.shtml & index-webarea.shtml
- index.shtml & index-webarea.shtml use JQuery version 3.1 (https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js) to make HTML dynamic
- In the search box you can search for book author or book name using keyword indexing. Example database has book with author Charles Fernyhough so you can search for “Fernyhough” or “light” etc.
- Show All button will show all the books in the database
